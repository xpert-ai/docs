XpertAI provides pre-built middleware for common use cases. Each middleware is production-tested and can be configured according to your specific needs.

## Provider-Agnostic Middleware

The following middleware works with any LLM provider:

| Middleware                              | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Context Compression](#context-compression) | Automatically summarize conversation history when approaching the session limit. |

### Context Compression

Automatically summarizes conversation history when approaching token limits, preserving recent messages while compressing older context. Summarization is suitable for the following scenarios:

* Long conversations that exceed the context window.
* Multi-turn conversations with extensive history.
* Applications that need to preserve complete conversation context.
